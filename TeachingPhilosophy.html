											<p>​I believe teaching and learning should be a joyful and empowering time for both students and educators, as when students are being respected and treated with dignity, students are able to use their voices, share their ideas and become respectful humans of their community and world. 
												Teaching should be culturally responsive as this will promote the success of all students equally, as I believe when teaching isn’t culturally responsive, classrooms and students will suffer from systemic discrimination.

												​
												
												I will do this by using a variety of tools and strategies to help students to become their best selves whilst initiate discussions within the classroom, and students’ innovators and critical thinkers.
												
											</p>
											<p>The use interactive technology such as smart whiteboards/tv, Web 2.0 tools including educational quizzes, applications, and games, QR Codes, blogging, E-Books, Online Learning management system (LMS) and Virtual Reality will help with creating a classroom full of creative, innovating thinkers and problem solvers.</p> 
											<p>Project-based learning is one of my beliefs of learning will lead to students developing stronger interest and curiosity within the classroom and within their life outside of school. Project-based learning will also develop students’ problem solving, decision making, and investigative skills as well as communication and interpersonal skills.
												
												​
												
												As a future educator of young minds, I also believe learning and teaching is a forever-changing career, I also believe is a collaborative process between education staff but also with students, parents, and caregivers. I also believe in being a flexible teacher that is able to deliver meaningful lessons and able to work with my students to increase their knowledge and skills</p>
