												<h2>About Me </h2>
											</header>
											<p>Hi! My name is Tamara and I am a current third year student at Australian Catholic Univesity, 
												I am studing a Bachelor of Education, Secondary and Bachelor or Arts - Technology</p>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Linkedin Picture .png" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Throughout my life, my family has developed a curiosity and passion for travel and cultures.

												After graduating high school in 2011, I worked in the corporate world however my curiosity for the world took over. 
												I packed up my life in 2016 and moved to Dubai, to travel and learn about the world as a flight attendant. </p>
												
												​
												
												​
												
												<p>During the next 5 years, I developed a passion for cuisines around the world  
												I started learning to cook the dishes I was having as I was traveling. As I was travelling the world, 
												I discovered that I was passionate about teaching others the things I was learning and experiencing. 
												Just before the pandemic hit, I realised I wanted to pursue this further and started my journey home and to becoming a TAS Teacher.</p>
												
												

												<h2> Why I Chose to become a TAS Teacher</h2>

												<p> I was drawn to becoming a TAS teacher, along with my passion for food and nutrition I also love having the ability to change young students’ 
													life, with giving them a creative break throughout the day relieving them of the stress and monotony of the day and developing their own passions and skill set. </p>

													<p>With an opportunity to increase resources I will be able to deeply engage and challenge my future students.
													I also thrive on developing and creating projects and overcoming practical and creative challenges.
													Within my teaching, I want to integrate technology into the classroom such as 3D printers, laser cutting machines, and CAD software this will give myself and my future students an opportunity to learn how technology can be used in design to create meaningful and engaging experiences.
													
													
													
													As a future teacher, I believe in being a lifelong learner, with this philosophy my future goals include increasing my skills and continuously furthering my knowledge and understanding of emerging and present technologies.
